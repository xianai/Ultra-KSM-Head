/*
 * A few notes about the KSM scanning process,
 * to make it easier to understand the data structures below:
 *
 * In order to reduce excessive scanning, KSM sorts the memory pages by their
 * contents into a data structure that holds pointers to the pages' locations.
 *
 * Since the contents of the pages may change at any moment, KSM cannot just
 * insert the pages into a normal sorted tree and expect it to find anything.
 * Therefore KSM uses two data structures - the stable and the unstable tree.
 *
 * The stable tree holds pointers to all the merged pages (ksm pages), sorted
 * by their contents.  Because each such page is write-protected, searching on
 * this tree is fully assured to be working (except when pages are unmapped),
 * and therefore this tree is called the stable tree.
 *
 * In addition to the stable tree, KSM uses a second data structure called the
 * unstable tree: this tree holds pointers to pages which have been found to
 * be "unchanged for a period of time".  The unstable tree sorts these pages
 * by their contents, but since they are not write-protected, KSM cannot rely
 * upon the unstable tree to work correctly - the unstable tree is liable to
 * be corrupted as its contents are modified, and so it is called unstable.
 *
 * KSM solves this problem by several techniques:
 *
 * 1) The unstable tree is flushed every time KSM completes scanning all
 *    memory areas, and then the tree is rebuilt again from the beginning.
 * 2) KSM will only insert into the unstable tree, pages whose hash value
 *    has not changed since the previous scan of all memory areas.
 * 3) The unstable tree is a RedBlack Tree - so its balancing is based on the
 *    colors of the nodes and not on their contents, assuring that even when
 *    the tree gets "corrupted" it won't get out of balance, so scanning time
 *    remains the same (also, searching and inserting nodes in an rbtree uses
 *    the same algorithm, so we have no overhead when we flush and rebuild).
 * 4) KSM never flushes the stable tree, which means that even if it were to
 *    take 10 attempts to find a page in the unstable tree, once it is found,
 *    it is secured in the stable tree.  (When we scan a new page, we first
 *    compare it against the stable tree, and then against the unstable tree.)
